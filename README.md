Smart weather station

Problem statement:

The goal of the project is to create a low-cost, low-power, reliable, accurate, easy to install and maintain weather station, with no mechanical moving parts for measuring all weather conditions with a focus on rain and wind, based on ultra-low power machine learning at the edge, that can be deployed locally.
This weather station can be deployed in a farm, for example, to provide local conditions and assist farmers in deciding when to plant crops.

Description :

Developing Countries is the area of the globe where land-based, in situ monitoring of weather and climate is at its scarcest, but at the same time has arguably the most potential to benefit society
Rainfall and temperature can have high spatial variability due to the strong feedback that can exist between the land and atmosphere. Temperature can change rapidly in space due to land-cover heterogeneity and changing altitude over complex mountainous terrain. This means that a weather station tens of kilometers away may measure conditions that have little relevance to your location, making it hard to make informed local decisions.

Attempts can be made to supplement weather information with satellite data, but these infer rainfall and near surface temperature at spatially averaged scales exceeding 10km and are subject to considerable uncertainties despite advances in sensor technology; moreover some data such as near surface winds or solar flux are not available at all.

Local weather information can have a huge impact on communities and applications enabled by granular weather data include agriculture, change in prices of commodities and early warning systems.

TinyML is a new technology that allows Machine Learning (ML) models to run on low-power microcontrollers that do not require a network infrastructure. We believe that TinyML has a great role to play not only to reach the SDGs, but also to facilitate scientific research in areas such as environmental monitoring, physics of complex systems and energy management.
